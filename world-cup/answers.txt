Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
As I have increased the number of simulations the decimal point moved to the left with every ten/hundred/thousand I have added.
For example with top 3 rankings and 10 Simulations I got a thousand %, then with a 100 I got a hundred %, with a 1000 I got a tens %
The predictions I then tend to say might not be accurate or incorrect would be of 1000000(million), as then all values were of 0.0%

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
There should be a treshold for acceptable %. Ideally till 1000 simulations. As the others do not add up to 100%.
